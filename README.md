## ABOUT
This is the Chinese language package of phpBB3.X, maintained by  [phpbbchina.com](http://www.phpbbchina.com), delivered with the converting and packaging scripts.  
The translation work was proceeded since 3.2.4.

## How can I use them?

I assume that you already have a working workspace with Git, PHP5.6+, OpenCC installed.
Check out the source code to your local machine
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MiltonLai/phpbb3-lang-chinese.git
```
then execute:
```bash
bin/build.sh
```

Now you will be able to the building process. When all stages are done, you will find the langage package and full pakcage under `build/` folder.
